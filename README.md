# Task 1 - My Lucky Number

Tomek loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations
contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Tomek wonders eagerly what minimum lucky number has the sum of digits equal to `N`. Help him cope with the task.
